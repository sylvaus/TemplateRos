# Template for ROS workspace
Developed on Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial) and ROS Kinetic
It should work out of the box with the desktop version of ROS
However, you may have to chmod +x the python file main.py

This is a ROS workspace template coming with:
* gtest (see: http://wiki.ros.org/gtest)
* Continous Integration using Travis and ROS Industrial CI (see: https://github.com/ros-industrial/industrial_ci)
